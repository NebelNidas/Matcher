# Matcher-IR
- **`Instance`**: Represents a concrete element implementation. You generally don't construct these manually. Possible element types are:
 - `ClassInstance`
 - `FieldInstance`
 - `MethodInstance`
 - `MethodArgInstance`
 - `MethodVarInstance`
- **`ClassEnv`**: Provider of `Instance`s, loaded and constructed from e.g. a JAR file.
- **`Identity`**: Identifies a semantically identical `Instance`s across `ClassEnv`s. These may even have disjointed hierarchies (a `MethodInstance` could change the parent `ClassIdentity` between `ClassEnv`s). Useful for applications like Matcher.
- Everything is lazy by default. Don't do any work if not explicitly requested by the user. Solved partly by using Streams.
- Everything is immutable.
